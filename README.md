## What is Quantum?

Quantum is a **native AI-powered IDE for macOS** built from the ground up with **SwiftUI** and **Apple's own frameworks** — no Electron, no web views, no compromises.

While other editors pretend to be Mac apps, Quantum breathes the same air as Finder, Xcode, and the Dock. It respects your RAM. It respects your battery. It respects *you*.

## Philosophy

```
if editor.isWrappedInChromium {
    throw IdeError.notOnMyMac
}
```

We believe your code editor should be as refined as the machine it runs on. Every pixel, every animation, every interaction — designed for macOS and nothing else.

**One platform. Zero apologies.**

## Built With

| | |
|---|---|
| **Language** | Swift 5 — fast, safe, expressive |
| **UI** | SwiftUI — declarative, native, beautiful |
| **Platform** | macOS (Apple Silicon optimized) |
| **Architecture** | async/await with MainActor isolation |
| **Security** | App Sandbox + Hardened Runtime |

## Why Quantum?

#### 🖥️ It's not a cross-platform afterthought
Every feature is designed for macOS first (and only). Native menus, native shortcuts, native *everything*.

#### ⚡ It launches before your coffee gets cold
No garbage collector. No JavaScript runtime warming up. Just compiled Swift hitting bare metal.

#### 🤝 It plays nice with your Mac
Proper window management. Proper dark mode. Proper trackpad gestures. Your Mac, your rules.

#### 🔋 Your battery will thank you
While Electron editors drain 4GB of RAM rendering a `<textarea>`, Quantum sips resources like fine whiskey.

## 💖 Made for Mac Lovers

This isn't just an app that *runs* on macOS. It's an app that *loves* macOS.

#### 🏠 Feels Like Home
Quantum follows Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/) because your editor shouldn't feel like a foreign app wearing a Mac costume. Native toolbar. Native sidebar. Native context menus. The kind of UI that makes you forget it's a third-party app.

#### 🔍 Spotlight & System Integration
Open files and projects straight from Spotlight. Quantum registers as a proper macOS citizen — Quick Look previews, Share extensions, Services menu, Handoff between your devices. Your editor, woven into your Mac.

#### 🖱️ Trackpad & Magic Mouse Gestures
Pinch to zoom your code. Two-finger swipe between tabs. Force Touch to peek at definitions. Quantum speaks the language your fingers already know.

#### 🪟 Stage Manager & Spaces Ready
Tile it, stack it, swipe it across desktops. Quantum respects macOS window management — including Stage Manager, Split View, and Mission Control — because fighting the OS is not a feature.

#### 🔄 Continuity & Handoff
Start editing on your MacBook at a coffee shop. Pick up exactly where you left off on your iMac at home. Your Mac ecosystem, your workflow, unbroken.

#### 🎨 Appearance That Adapts
Dynamic wallpaper tinting. Vibrancy. Materials. Quantum doesn't just support dark mode — it uses the same translucent, layered design language that makes macOS beautiful.

#### ⌨️ Menu Bar & Keyboard Shortcuts
Every action reachable from the menu bar. Every shortcut following the conventions your muscle memory already owns — `Cmd+S`, `Cmd+P`, `Cmd+Shift+F` — no surprises, no remapping, no "but on Mac it's different."

#### 💻 Touch Bar & Notch Aware
For those who still rock the Touch Bar — context-aware controls while you code. And yes, it plays nicely with the notch. Every Mac, every era.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/vothaianh/quantum.git

# Open in Xcode
open quantum.xcodeproj

# Build & Run (Cmd + R)
# That's it. No npm install. No node_modules black hole.
```

**Requirements:**
- macOS 26.2+
- Xcode 26+
- A deep appreciation for native software

## 🤖 AI-Native IDE

Quantum isn't an editor with AI bolted on as an afterthought. It's an **AI IDE** — intelligence is a first-class citizen, not a plugin.

### Phase 1: Terminal Agents *(current)*

Quantum ships with built-in support for the terminal-based AI agents you already love:

| Agent | Status |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | ✅ Supported |
| **OpenAI Codex CLI** | ✅ Supported |
| **Gemini CLI** | ✅ Supported |
| **Aider** | ✅ Supported |

Quantum's integrated terminal gives these agents full access to your project — file edits, git operations, build commands — all rendered beautifully inside a native macOS environment. No more switching between your editor and a separate terminal window. Your AI agent lives where your code lives.

### Phase 2: Deep Integration *(coming soon)*

- Inline AI suggestions powered by multiple providers
- Agent-aware diff viewer — see what your AI changed at a glance
- One-click accept/reject for AI-generated edits
- Conversation history tied to your project, not lost in a terminal scroll
- Native AI model selector in the toolbar

### Phase 3: Beyond *(the future)*

- Multi-agent orchestration — run different agents on different tasks simultaneously
- AI-powered code review before you commit
- Voice-to-code with Whisper + local models
- On-device inference with Apple Neural Engine

> *Your AI agent deserves a better home than a raw terminal.*
> *Quantum gives it one.*

## 🗺️ Roadmap

Quantum is in active development. Here's where we're headed:

- [x] Native SwiftUI foundation
- [x] Apple Silicon optimized builds
- [x] App Sandbox security model
- [x] Integrated terminal with AI agent support
- [ ] Lightning-fast code editor engine
- [ ] Syntax highlighting for 50+ languages
- [ ] Git built right in
- [ ] Agent-aware diff viewer
- [ ] Project navigator & file browser
- [ ] Theme engine (dark, light, and everything in between)
- [ ] Multi-tab & split-view editing
- [ ] Plugin architecture
- [ ] Command palette
- [ ] Multi-agent orchestration
- [ ] On-device AI with Apple Neural Engine

## The Name

**Quantum** — because great code exists in a superposition of possibilities until you run it. And because, like quantum mechanics, the best software is elegant, powerful, and slightly magical.

## Contributing

Quantum is a passion project. If you love macOS and believe native apps still matter, you're already one of us.
